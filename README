humanizer
Python script that simulates human-like typing. Uses machine learning and other advanced algorithms to provide authentic, humanlike typing.

Setup Instructions

1. Dependencies
   - Python 3.x
   - Required Python packages (pip install):
     - pyautogui
     - numpy
     - tqdm
     - scikit-learn

2. Installation
   - Clone the repository or download the script directly.

3. Configuration
   - Ensure all required dependencies are installed.
   - Set up the Python environment with necessary packages.

4. Typing Profiles
   - Edit typing_profiles.json to customize typing styles (slow, average, fast):
     ```
     {
       "slow": {"delay_range": [0.15, 0.4], "typo_probability": 0.15},
       "average": {"delay_range": [0.05, 0.2], "typo_probability": 0.05},
       "fast": {"delay_range": [0.01, 0.1], "typo_probability": 0.02}
     }
     ```

 Usage
- Run the script by executing python humanizer.py.
- Follow the prompts to select a typing style (slow, average, fast).
- Input the text to be typed when prompted (END on a new line to finish).
- The script will simulate typing the input text with variations in typing speed and potential typos.
- Upon completion, it will display typing statistics including time taken, words per minute (WPM), number of typos, and error rate.
